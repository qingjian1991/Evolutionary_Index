# Evolutionary_Index

Here, we define a new Amino aicd(AA) distance based on Ui, where Ui is from Tang et al. (2004).

The D_Ui = {max(Ui)- Ui}/{max(Ui)-min(Ui)}

The formate of dUi.dat is same with miyata.dat in PAML dat datasets. So we can use the dUi as a new AA distance. In addition, the dUi.dat can be used in PAML.



The D_Ui has a high likelihood than the miyata's and grantham's distance, thus is a good AA distance (See Chen et al. (2019)).
